# QuarryIO
A Minecraft Mod which attempts to add various now defunct quarry mods (Extra Utilities 1.7.10 Ender Quarry, 1.12.2 Quantum Quarry, and the BuildCraft Quarry) to 1.18.2+ Forge.
# Why?
I started playing a modpack, basically Better Minecraft crossed with Direpack and noticed that there was a lack of good quarry options 
(FTB Industrial Contraptions quarry seems unrefiend for my testing in creative). 
I've been playing modded minecraft for a very long time and my favourites have always been the BuldCraft Quarry and the Ender Quarry from Extra Utilties. 
So here they are!
# TODO:
### Quarries:
-Ender Quarry (high)
-Buildcraft Quarry (med)
-Quantum Quarry (low)
### Upgrades:
-Ender Quarry attachable upgrades (high)
-Buildcraft quarry enchantments? (low)
-Quantum Quarry speed upgrades? (low)
