# QuarryIO
A Minecraft Mod which attempts to add various now defunct quarry mods (Extra Utilities 1.7.10 Ender Quarry, 1.12.2 Quantum Quarry, and the BuildCraft Quarry) to 1.18.2+ Forge.
# Why?
I started playing a modpack, basically Better Minecraft crossed with Direpack and noticed that there was a lack of good quarry options 
(FTB Industrial Contraptions quarry seems unrefiend for my testing in creative). 
I've been playing modded minecraft for a very long time and my favourites have always been the BuldCraft Quarry and the Ender Quarry from Extra Utilties. 
So here they are!
# Fabric / Older Forge?
Yes, I am planning to do a fabric port at time point, however the lack of good stable APIs for energy may prevent this. If you know of one, please message me as I am not up to date on fabric shenanigans. <br>
Older versions of forge (1.16.5) will eventually come, assuming this project gains support.
